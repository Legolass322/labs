1. Continuous Integration (CI)
    
    CI is a practice of constantly integrating code changes into a repository. It allows teams to detect and fix errors early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of bugs and conflicts. (*`GitHub Actions`, `GitLab Pipelines`, etc*)

2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
    
    Continuous Delivery is a practice of delivering releases to next stages. It ensures that applications can be easily and safely deployed to any environment. (*`GitHub Actions`, `GitLab Pipelines`, etc*)

3. Infrastructure as Code

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of defining and managing infrastructure using code. It involves using configuration files, scripts, and other tools to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources. (*`Docker`, `K8S`, etc*)

4. Continuous Monitoring

    Continuous Monitoring is a practice of monitoring application performance, security, and availability in real-time. It involves using tools and automation to detect and resolve issues as they arise. (*`Prometheus`, etc*)

5. Automated Testing

    Automated Testing is a practice of using software tools to execute tests automatically. It includes unit tests, functional tests, integration tests, and performance tests. Automated testing helps to ensure consistent and reliable software quality, reduces manual effort. (*`Jest`, `Puppeter`, etc*)

6. Collaboration and Communication

    Collaboration and Communication are essential DevOps practices that involve fostering teamwork, open communication, and collaboration across all stakeholders. It includes using collaboration tools, project management platforms, and agile meetings to ensure that teams are aligned and working together towards a common goal. (*`Calendar`, `Tracker`, etc*)
