# Software Distibution Strategies

Software distribution is the process of delivering software to the end user

Basically the way software is distibuted directly affects business goals

## Startegies

1. Packaged
   - extra cost and effort of developing brick-n-mortal retail distribution channel
   - not recommended to startups
2. Premium
   - revenue through stores like App Store and Google Play
   - or self-made "store"
3. Freemium
   - revenue with monetization options in the app, which is free
   - simple model
4. Pre-installed
   - a second freemium model is available that can bypass the uncertainty of advertising. Users pay the Original Equipment Manufacturer to pre-install your software on their device before it ever gets sent to user.
5. Subscribtions and SaaS, PaaS, XaaS
   - predictable revenue
6. White Label Option
   - owner can license software to other businesses
